  <h1>⚙️ Advanced Features</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Advanced features use AI, IoT, and data analytics to improve traffic flow, safety, and efficiency. These features make the system smarter and more adaptive to real-time changes on the road.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>AI-powered traffic prediction and congestion avoidance</li>
      <li>Dynamic lane and signal control based on real-time density</li>
      <li>Integration with emergency vehicle priority systems</li>
      <li>Real-time weather and road condition alerts</li>
      <li>Automatic rerouting during accidents or blockages</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      The system collects data from cameras, sensors, connected vehicles, and satellite feeds. This data is processed using machine learning to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Predict traffic jams before they occur</li>
      <li>Automatically manage green light times at signals</li>
      <li>Send alerts to drivers via mobile and onboard units</li>
      <li>Update digital road signs instantly</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Benefits</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Reduced travel time and fuel consumption</li>
      <li>Fewer accidents due to real-time warnings</li>
      <li>Better response during emergencies</li>
      <li>More efficient use of road space</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Future Upgrades</h2>
    <p>
      Planned future features include self-healing road surfaces, autonomous traffic control AI, and full integration with electric and self-driving vehicles.
